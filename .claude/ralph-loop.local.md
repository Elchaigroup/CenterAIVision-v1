The Gradient Blinds background from React Bits is currently visible but not interactive with the cursor. In the official React Bits example, this background responds to cursor movement. Fix this behavior so the gradient reacts correctly to mouse interaction.

Additionally, update the following UI elements to use React Bits interactive components instead of static or custom implementations:

Navbar

Cards

All major UI components that support interaction

Replace existing components with their React Bits equivalents where available. Ensure that:

Cursor-based interactions work as demonstrated in the React Bits examples.

Hover, focus, and motion effects behave consistently across all components.

The UI feels fully interactive, responsive, and cohesive.

Unused or redundant custom styles get removed.

The final result matches the interaction quality shown in the official React Bits demos.

Refactor and clean the code where needed, while preserving existing layout and content unless a change is required for interaction support.
